# IPDFCameraViewController

[![Gratipay](https://img.shields.io/gratipay/mmackh.svg)](https://gratipay.com/mmackh/)

Welcome to the spiritual successor of [MAImagePickerController](https://github.com/mmackh/MAImagePickerController-of-InstaPDF), that tries to unite a usable & simple camera component class into a single UIView. Initially written as an essential component of InstaPDF 4.0 for [instapdf.com](https://instapdf.com), it seemed too useful to keep closed source. Plus we're celebrating our 100,000 document upload ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Leave all the hard work dealing with AVFoundation, border detection and OpenGL up to IPDFCameraViewController. It includes:

  - Live border detection & perspective correction
  - Flash / Torch
  - Image filters
  - Simple API
 
**WARNING: MINIMUM iOS VERSION REQUIREMENT: 8.0**

Take a look at the sample project to find out how to use it.
